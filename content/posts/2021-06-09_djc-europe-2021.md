Last week, [DjangoCon Europe 2021](https://2021.djangocon.eu/) took place completelly online from the 2<sup>nd</sup> to the 6<sup>th</sup> of June. I was the lead co-organizer and it took a lot of work! The conference main focus is the web framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), it happens yearly in Europe, and it includes 5 days of talks, sprints, and tutorials.

Orginally, the conference was planned to take place phisically at the [Super Bock Arena](https://www.superbockarena.pt/) in Porto, Portugal; we had to shift to a different approach and make a virtual conference (yet again).

Despite the event having "Europe" in its name, it was trully a worlwide event with people watching from **all continents** without exceptions! Ok, maybe Antarctica... Since everything was online there was no need to travel, and, no matter where you were, you could attend it as along as you had a device with internet connection.

If you are looking for resources, there are several [awesome organiser resources](https://github.com/stephlocke/awesome-organiser-resources), from which I'd highlight the [The Less Obvious Conference Checklist](https://github.com/mxsasha/lessobviouschecklist).

In terms of platforms & software, we've used [LoudSwarm](https://djc2021.loudswarm.com/) as the virtual venue; [beamian](https://a.beamian.com/#/event/djangocon-europe-2021) as the ticketing platform; [Gather.Town](https://gather.town/i/44zJkuo1) for the social track, where you walk with your own avatar from Pok√©mon-like map in a Game Boy; [pretalx](https://cfp.2021.djangocon.eu/2021/schedule/) as the call for participation & scheduling tool; [Slack](https://djangoconeurope2021.slack.com/) as the chat app; and [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) for the Q&A with the speakers (these last two already integrated in LoudSwarm). And that is just for the "frontend" of the conference, of course the list doesn't end here. In the "backend", we've used [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for the streaming from a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) call with the speakers; the [website](https://2021.djangocon.eu/) was proudly built on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/); several shared Google [Docs](http://docs.google.com/document/), [Sheets](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) & [Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/); and the list goes on. Overall, this is a good example of the complexity involved in organizing such an event, just touching on the software tools involved in a virtual conference.

Another example where this complexity is visible is in the different teams of volunteers involved: content, financial aid, conduct, social, public relations, support, diversity, sponsors and djangogirls - I literally had to check the list right now because of how many they are, which just proves my point: **organizing a conference is extremelly complex.**

At the end of the day, although it required a lot of stressfull work, **it was an highly rewarding experience** - being able to see that what you have created had such a huge impact on everyone involved!
