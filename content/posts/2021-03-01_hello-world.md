Let's start with the computer programming *cliché* phrase:

`> Hello, World`

It's 2021 and I'm currently living in France as a grad student in a computer science program. *"Inspired by the French writers Victor Hugo, Voltaire, and Gustave Flaubert, I've decided to start my blog!"* - not really, but I admit it would *be cooler*. This will be the place to share my personal projects, ideas, and experiences.

Before starting any project, such as this blog, I think it is important to define what you want to achieve, your goals. Even if you already have an idea in your mind, things will become clearer and more transparent if you **write them down**. For example, I find it particularly useful to draw some sketches before implementing a complex algorithm.

Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the [learning by teaching](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/) effect, i.e., that *"learning is enhanced through the act of teaching others"* [^1]. A peculiar instance of this phenomenon is the *rubber duck debugging* from [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer), where a programmer debugs their code by explaining it line-by-line to a rubber duck.

**The main idea to retain is that when you lay things down, you will improve your understanding of the concepts you are dealing with, and how they interact between each other.** And that is the main objective of this blog, the fact that some of you might find this useful is just a plus, since I do not plan to have a large audience anyway.
