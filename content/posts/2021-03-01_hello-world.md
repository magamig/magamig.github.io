Let's start with the computer programming *cliché* phrase:

`> Hello, World`

It's 2021 and I'm currently living in France. *"Inspired by the french writers Victor Hugo, Voltaire and Gustave Flaubert, I've decided to start my own blog!"* - not really, but I admit it would *look cooler*. This will just be the place to share my personal projects, ideas and experiences.

Before starting any project, such as this blog, it is important to define what you want to archieve, your goals. Even if you have an idea in your mind, things will become clearer and more transparent if you **write them down**. For example, I find it particularly useful to draw some sketches before implementing a complex algorithm.

Moreover, the [learning by teaching](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/) effect which says *"learning is enhanced through the act of teaching others"*[^1] has been demonstrated in several studies. A peculiar instance of this phenomena is the *rubber duck debugging* from [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer), where a programmer debugs their code by explaining it line-by-line to a rubber duck.

**The main idea to retain is that when you lay things down, you will improve your understanding of the concepts you are dealing with, and how they interact between each other.** The fact that some of you might find this useful is just a plus, since I do not plan to have a large audience anyway.
