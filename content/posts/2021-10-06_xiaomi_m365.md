Recently, I've been riding my Xiaomi M365 quite a lot during this summer in sunny Portugal. However, since I'm 1.93m and weight over 90kg, the electric scooter has some issues on handling steep inclines (specially on cobblestone, which is extremely common over here).

To improve the riding experience, I've decided to mod the scooter. When doing this, one must take into account the balance between the extra power and the motor/battery wear.

❗ **Warning**<br/>
This is not recommended by Xiaomi and will probably void your warranty, so **proceed at your own risk**.

Having said that, here are the steps to mod your Xiaomi M365:
1. Customize the firmware ([m365.botox.bz](https://m365.botox.bz/))
2. Transfer the output ```zip``` to an Android phone
3. Using [m365 DownG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.m365downgrade) flash your scooter (this app also provides some extra useful information regarding your scooter: number of battery cycles, production date, etc.)

My preferred settings (different from default firmware) are listed below:

| Field | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Firmware version | 1.3.8 | preferred by the community |
| KERS min speed | 40 | personal max confortable & safe speed |
| Max speed | 40 | speed up to which the motor works |
| Start speed | 2 | speed at which motor starts |
| Power constant | 32000 | minimum recommended (↓=↑power) |
| Cruise control delay | 3s | time delay to start cruise control |
| Russian throttle | True | custom algorithm |
