Currently studying [IMLEX Computational Imaging MSc](https://imlex.org/) at KU Leuven in Belgium. Using this blog to put things into writing. My topics of interest revolve around images and maps. 

When I'm not in front of a screen, I'm probably motorcycling, playing music at [TUM](https://www.facebook.com/tunauniversitariaminho), walking in the woods, or having a [beer](/beers/) with friends.

You can also find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/magamig23/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magamig/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/magamig).
