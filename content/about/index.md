Currently studying [IMLEX Computational Imaging MSc](https://imlex.org/) at Université Jean Monnet in France. Using this blog to put things into writing. My topics of interest revolve around images and maps. 

When I'm not in front of a screen, I'm probably motorcycling, playing music at [TUM](https://www.facebook.com/tunauniversitariaminho), walking in the woods, or having a beer with friends.
