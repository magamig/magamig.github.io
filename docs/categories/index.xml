      <description>In image processing, a kernel (convolution matrix, or mask) is a small matrix used to apply effects to an image, such as blurring, sharpening or outlining. These effects are accomplished by performing a convolution between a kernel and an image.
This technique is also used in the field of deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this context, we try to learn the weights for each element of the matrix in order to improve the score of our model.</description>

      <description>If creating your personal page has been on your mind for a while, I hope this blog post inspires you to go through with it. This is not intended to be a manual, but an overview of my own process.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve previously mentioned, it is important to define some guidelines of what we want to achieve (even if later on we need to change them). As such, this webpage is intended to be lightweight and fast.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the computer programming cliché phrase:
&amp;gt; Hello, World
It&amp;rsquo;s 2021 and I&amp;rsquo;m currently living in France as a grad student in a computer science program. &amp;ldquo;Inspired by the French writers Victor Hugo, Voltaire, and Gustave Flaubert, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start my blog!&amp;quot; - not really, but I admit it would be cooler. This will be the place to share my personal projects, ideas, and experiences.
Before starting any project, such as this blog, I think it is important to define what you want to achieve, your goals.</description>
