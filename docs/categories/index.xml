This is not intended to be a manual, but an overview of my own process.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve previously mentioned, it is important to define some guidelines of what we want to achieve (even if later on we need to change them). As such, this webpage is intended to be lightweight and fast.</description></item><item><title>Hello, World!</title><link>/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the computer programming cliché phrase:

This will just be the place to share my personal projects, ideas, and experiences.
Before starting any project, such as this blog, it is important to define what you want to achieve, your goals.</description></item></channel></rss>
