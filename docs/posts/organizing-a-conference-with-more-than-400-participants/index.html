¬∑ France</time></header><p><img src=/image/gathertown.png alt></p><p>Last week, <a href=https://2021.djangocon.eu/ target=_blank>DjangoCon Europe 2021</a> took place completelly online from the 2<sup>nd</sup> to the 6<sup>th</sup> of June. This yearly european conference focuses on the web framework <a href=https://www.djangoproject.com/ target=_blank>Django</a>, and it includes 5 days of talks, sprints, and tutorials. I was the lead co-organizer and it was both extremelly fullfilling and completelly exhausting!</p><p>Orginally, the conference was planned to take place physically at the <a href=https://www.superbockarena.pt/ target=_blank>Super Bock Arena</a> in Porto, Portugal; we had to shift to a different approach and make the conference virtual (yet again).</p><p>Despite the event having &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; in its name, it was trully a worlwide event with people watching from <strong>all continents</strong> without exceptions! Ok, maybe Antarctica&mldr; Since everything was online there was no need to travel, and, no matter where you were, you could attend it as along as you had a device with internet connection. As a result, it drew over 400 participants.</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>Numbers from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DjangoCon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DjangoCon</a> Europe 2021<br><br>‚≠êÔ∏è 425 Attendees<br>‚≠êÔ∏è 41 Speakers<br>‚≠êÔ∏è 18 Time Zones</p>&mdash; DjangoCon Europe (@DjangoConEurope) <a href="https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope/status/1400869658031538183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>If you are looking for resources, there are several <a href=https://github.com/stephlocke/awesome-organiser-resources target=_blank>awesome organiser resources</a>, from which I&rsquo;d highlight the <a href=https://github.com/mxsasha/lessobviouschecklist target=_blank>The Less Obvious Conference Checklist</a>.</p><p>In terms of platforms & software, we&rsquo;ve used <a href=https://djc2021.loudswarm.com/ target=_blank>LoudSwarm</a> as the virtual venue; <a href=https://a.beamian.com/#/event/djangocon-europe-2021 target=_blank>beamian</a> as the ticketing platform; <a href=https://gather.town/i/44zJkuo1 target=_blank>Gather.Town</a> for the social track, where you could walk with your own avatar in a Pok√©mon-like map as if it was a Game Boy (pictured above); <a href=https://cfp.2021.djangocon.eu/2021/schedule/ target=_blank>pretalx</a> as the call for participation & scheduling tool; <a href=https://djangoconeurope2021.slack.com/ target=_blank>Slack</a> as the chat app; and <a href=https://jitsi.org/ target=_blank>Jitsi</a> for the Q&amp;A with the speakers (these last two already integrated in LoudSwarm). And that is just for the &ldquo;frontend&rdquo; of the conference, of course the list doesn&rsquo;t end here. In the &ldquo;backend&rdquo;, we&rsquo;ve used <a href=https://obsproject.com/ target=_blank>OBS</a> for the streaming from a <a href=https://zoom.us/ target=_blank>Zoom</a> call with the speakers; the <a href=https://2021.djangocon.eu/ target=_blank>website</a> was proudly built on <a href=https://www.djangoproject.com/ target=_blank>Django</a>; several shared Google <a href=http://docs.google.com/document/ target=_blank>Docs</a>, <a href=http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/ target=_blank>Sheets</a> & <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/ target=_blank>Forms</a>; and the list goes on. Overall, this is a good example of the complexity involved in organizing such an event, and just touching on the software tools involved in a virtual conference.</p><p>Another example where this complexity is visible is in the different teams of volunteers involved: content, financial aid, conduct, social, public relations, support, diversity, sponsors and djangogirls - I literally had to check the list right now because of how many there are, which just proves my point: <strong>organizing a conference is extremelly complex</strong> - there are numerous little pieces all over the place and they all need to be working together to create a great experience for everyone.</p><p>At the end of the day, although it required a lot of stressfull work, it was <strong>an highly rewarding experience</strong> - being able to see that what you have created together with several others had such a huge impact. As a final remark, I&rsquo;d like to leave a big thank you to all the amazing people that made this conference such success: speakers, attendees, sponsors and volunteers!</p><div class=info><p><strong>For more information:</strong><br>üåê <a href=https://2021.djangocon.eu/ target=_blank>Website</a><br>üìÖ <a href=https://cfp.2021.djangocon.eu/2021/schedule/ target=_blank>Schedule</a><br>üé§ <a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/djangoconeurope target=_blank>Talk Recordings</a></p></div></article></main><footer id=footer></footer><div></body></html>
